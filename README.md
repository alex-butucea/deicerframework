# Deicer Framework
A PSR-2 compliant Data Access Layer framework for modern PHP applications.

This is very much a work in progress, however if this helps you or you're just passing through and like what you see, feel free to drop me a line.

## Framework Components
The framework is comprised of the following components:

- `Deicer\Exception` - Semantic exception hierarchy
- `Deicer\Model` - Base classes for DTO and Value Objects
- `Deicer\Query` - Read only Data Access Objects
- `Deicer\Stdlib` - Generic interfaces

See the README.md contained within the root of each component for more info.

## System Requirements
Deicer Framework requires PHP 5.3.3 or later.
