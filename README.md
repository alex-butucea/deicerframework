Colt Framework
==============
A collection of solutions to common challenges encountered while developing PHP applications.
Framework components have been implemented using recognised design patterns that promote loosely coupled, easily testable code.
All code has been written with standards in mind and is PSR-2 compliant.

This is very much a work in progress, however if this helps you or you're just passing through and like what you see, feel free to drop me a line.

Framework Components
--------------------
The framework is comprised of the following components:

- Colt\Exception - Semantic exception hierarchy
- Colt\Model - Domain business object templates
- Colt\Stdlib - Generic interfaces and implementations

See the README.md contained within the root of each component for more info

System Requirements
-------------------
Colt Framework requires PHP 5.3.3 or later.
